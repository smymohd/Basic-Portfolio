      <p>“You love the roses – so do I. I wish
            The sky would rain down roses, as they rain
            From off the shaken bush.  Why will it not?
            Then all the valley would be pink and white
            And soft to tread on. They would fall as light
            As feathers, smelling sweet; and it would be
            Like sleeping and like waking, all at once!”
            -George Eliot, Roses</p>
